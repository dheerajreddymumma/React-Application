# React-Application for Resturant Management

Designed and implemented a cross-platform interactive open source application(Web & Mobile) which allows managers to manage the availability of the tables and dishes in their restaurant and allows customers to reserve
a table, browse through the menu, mark favorites and leave comments/ratings on dishes.

Received rave reviews from senior developers and mangers at the Zomatoâ€™s Hackathon event.
